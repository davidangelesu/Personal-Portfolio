# About Class

For the Class of Parallel Programming (IN2147), we had multiple exercises. We solved multiple excersices with different parallelization approaches and APIs.

# Final Project

For the Final Project we parallelized a gaussian elimination and backward substitution algorithm for solving a linear system of equations. 
We implemented different parallelization approaches, pure OpenMP, MPI and Hybrid approach. As the program was run in a NUMA server, the best performance was obtained with a pure OpenMP paralelization.
