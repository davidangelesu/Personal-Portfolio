# About Class

For the Class of Introduction to Deep Learning (IN2346), we had multiple excersices. We started with implementing the Neural Network in Python. 
We implemented different types of neurons and the logic to propagate and backpropagate to be able to train the NN.

After implementing our Neural Networks, we started utilizing PyTorch. A Neural  Network for predicting the CIFAR10 dataset was designed.
Additionally, Optuna was utilized for optimizing the Hyperparameters driving the learning in our Neural Networks & Tensorboard was used to visualize the learning progress.
