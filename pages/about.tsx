					Hi, I am a Software Engineer üë®‚Äçüíª based in Munich with a nonconventional journey into the Computer Science world. I started my academic career at CETYS University in Mexicali, Mexico pursuing my Undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering üî®. I decided to continue my studies with a Master degree in Computational Mechanics at the Technical University of Munich. It is here where I found my passion in Computer Science as I was exposed into amazing applications and courses during my studies.
				</p>
				<br /><p>
					I decided to pursue a career in the world of software development as I am drawn into crafting and solving complex problems and applications. I have strong professional experience in frontend engineering focused on crafting intricated web applications.
				</p><br /><p>
					My strong analytical background has shaped my ability to dive into challenging projects not only limited to the frontend domain. I am not a framework-specific developer, as I believe in mastering the fundamentals of software engineering and adapting to the tools that best suit the problem at hand. While I have proven expertise in React, my skills are not limited by any one framework. I focus on understanding the underlying principles of development, which enables me to quickly dive into and work with a variety of technologies as needed to deliver the best possible solution.
